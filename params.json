{"name":"Emfviews","tagline":"EMF Views","body":"EMF Views\r\n========\r\n\r\nVisit the [webpage of the project](http://emfviews.jdvillacalle.com/) for the newest demos and documentation.\r\n\r\nNews:\r\n\r\n* Brand new Enterprise Architecture Views Tutorial.\r\n\r\nWhat is this project about?\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nSome users only need to see some parts of a model,  others have to get the full model extended with data from another model, and others simply access to a combination of information coming from different models. Based on the unquestionable success/usefulness of database views to solve similar problems in databases, EMF Views aims to bring the same concept to the modeling world. \r\n\r\nWhat can you find in this repository?\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSo far, these are the projects:\r\n\r\n* fr.inria.atlanmod.emfviews. This project is the main component of the tool. It includes the logic behind viewtypes and views.\r\n* fr.inria.atlanmod.emfviews.ui. This project contributes to the Eclipse UI by defining wizards to ease the creation of viewtypes and views. \r\n* fr.inria.atlanmod.emfviews.editor. This project contributes to Eclipse UI, by defining an editor to modify viewtypes and views.\r\n* fr.inria.atlanmod.emfviews.vlink-mm. EMF project defining an Ecore model to represent links models.\r\n* fr.inria.atlanmod.emfviews.virtuallinksdelegator. This project delegates the creation of virtual links to concrete implementations\r\n* fr.inria.atlanmod.emfviews.virtuallinksepsilondelegate. This project allows to generate links from the Epsilon Comparison Language (ECL).\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\n* myFirstViewTutorial. Create your first Viewtype and View.\r\n* myFirstViewTransformationTutorial. Create your first M2M transformation using a View as input\r\n* enterpriseEAtutorial. Create more complex views in an Enterprise Architecture context.\r\n\r\nWho is behind this project?\r\n---------------------------\r\n* [Juan David Villa Calle](https://github.com/juandavidvillacalle \"Juan David Villa Calle\")\r\n* [Hugo Bruneliere](https://github.com/Hugo-Bruneliere \"Jordi Cabot\")\r\n\r\nJuan David and Hugo work in [Atlanmod](http://www.emn.fr/z-info/atlanmod), a research team of Inria.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
