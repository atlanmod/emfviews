What is this project about?
---------------------------

Some users only need to see some parts of a model,  others have to get the full model extended with data from another model, and others simply access to a combination of information coming from different models. Based on the unquestionable success/usefulness of database views to solve similar problems in databases, EMF Views aims to bring the same concept to the modeling world.
