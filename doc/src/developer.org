#+Title: EMF Views Developer Guide

* How EMF Views works
We create virtual elements that stand-off for each element in the contributing
models.

See the [[file:user.org::*Glossary][the Glossary]].

Also see [[file:user.org][the user manual]].

# A picture of data coming in and out of the different EMF Views classes
# (pipeline) would be very handy, as an overview

* Adding matching models
There's an extension point and an interface to implement.
