#+Title: EMF Views Documentation

The EMF Views documentation is split into two manuals.

The [[file:user.org][User Guide]] describes how to install the plugin and how to create views
interactively or programmatically.

The [[file:developer.org][Developer Guide]] describes the internal architecture of EMF Views.
