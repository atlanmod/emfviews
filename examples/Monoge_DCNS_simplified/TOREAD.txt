This project is an example of a metamodel extension using Monoge. Once that the extension
has been defined with the DSL (monoge.dsl...) and the saved model of the definition
transformed into virtuallinks model (with Mel2VirtualLinks.atl), the generated viewpoint.xmi
 has to be copied into this project, into the "resources" folder.

In the .eviewpoint they have to be specified the url of the original MM and the path to
the viewpoint in the resources folder, like this:

contributingMetamodels=Monoge_DoDAF2NAF/metamodels/DODAF.ecore
correspondenceModel=Monoge_DoDAF2NAF/viewpoints/DODAFextension4NAF.xmi
correspondenceModelBase=Monoge_DoDAF2NAF/viewpoints/DODAFextension4NAF.ecl
filtersMetamodel=/Monoge_DoDAF2NAF/viewpoints/DODAFextension4NAF.ecore
originalMetamodel=http://DODAF/1.0
viewpointModel=platform:/resource/Monoge_DoDAF2NAF/resources/extendedMMviewpoint.xmi
